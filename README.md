# api-test
api test hometrack

This is my playground - experimenting with JSON files to front-end framework with data coming from an ATLAS MongoDB database.

1. The source code to this app is located in my public GIT repository. https://github.com/sallymoussa/api-test I would probably need to send a GIT invite

2. The database containing the seed data is located in my MongoDB ATLAS account. The link to the ATLAS database is in the code and it contains the username and password
